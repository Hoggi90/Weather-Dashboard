# Weather Dashboard

## Desciption

### This project involved me creating a webpage that displayed the forecast for the current day as well as the next 5 days for any city searched for. The involved using javascript, CSS and Bootstrap. I created the structure dynamically as well as saving searched cities into localstorage and having the buttons remain on the page. I chose London, my hometown as the default city when the page first loads.


# Usage

## You can access the page via this link: https://hoggi90.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

### Type in any city in the search bar and the forecast will appear. Click on the buttons that populate in the list to go back to a previous search.

### Right-click on the browser and choose inspect, then click on elements to view the JS script, HTML and CSS files.
